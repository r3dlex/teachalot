	abstract = {Experts estimate that as many as 98,000 people die in any given year from medical errors that occur in hospitals. That's more than die from motor vehicle accidents, breast cancer, or AIDS--three causes that receive far more public attention. Indeed, more people die annually from medication errors than from workplace injuries. Add the financial cost to the human tragedy, and medical error easily rises to the top ranks of urgent, widespread public problems.\n\nTo Err Is Human breaks the silence that has surrounded medical errors and their consequence--but not by pointing fingers at caring health care professionals who make honest mistakes. After all, to err is human.\nInstead, this book sets forth a national agenda--with state and local implications--for reducing medical errors and improving patient safety through the design of a safer health system.\n\nThis volume reveals the often startling statistics of medical error and the disparity between the incidence of error and public perception of it, given many patients' expectations that the medical profession always performs perfectly. A careful examination is made of how the surrounding forces of legislation, regulation, and market activity influence the quality of care provided by health care organizations and then looks at their handling of medical mistakes.\n\nUsing a detailed case study, the book reviews the current understanding of why these mistakes happen. A key theme is that legitimate liability concerns discourage reporting of errors--which begs the question, {\"H}ow can we learn from our mistakes?"\n\nBalancing regulatory versus market-based initiatives and public versus private efforts, the Institute of Medicine presents wide-ranging recommendations for improving patient safety, in the areas of leadership, improved data collection and analysis, and development of effective systems at the level of direct patient care.\n\nTo Err Is Human asserts that the problem is not bad people in health care--it is that good people are working in bad systems that need to be made safer. Comprehensive and straightforward, this book offers a clear prescription for raising the level of patient safety in American health care. It also explains how patients themselves can influence the quality of care that they receive once they check into the hospital. This book will be vitally important to federal, state, and local health policy makers and regulators, health professional licensing officials, hospital administrators, medical educators and students, health caregivers,\nhealth journalists, patient advocates--as well as patients themselves.\n\n First in a series of publications from the Quality of Health Care in America, a project initiated by the Institute of Medicine\n},

	abstract = {Americans should be able to count on receiving health care that is safe. \n\nTo achieve this, a new health care delivery system is needed \u2014 a system that both prevents errors from occurring, and learns from them when they do occur. The development of such a system requires a commitment by all stakeholders to a culture of safety and to the development of improved information systems for the delivery of health care. This national health information infrastructure is needed to provide immediate access to complete patient information and decision-support tools for clinicians and their patients. In addition, this infrastructure must capture patient safety information as a by-product of care and use this information to design even safer delivery systems. Health data standards are both a critical and time-sensitive building block of the national health information infrastructure. \n\nBuilding on the Institute of Medicine reports To Err Is Human and Crossing the Quality Chasm, Patient Safety puts forward a road map for the development and adoption of key health care data standards to support both information exchange and the reporting and analysis of patient safety data.\n\n\n},

In the mental health arena is being used for specific therapeutic contexts and is an especially difficult environment due to specificities of the patients' conditions; the physical access to patients is restricted and, sometimes, not even possible. Thus, a PCD approach can be accomplished through the health professionals involved, applying some of the most well-known methods of UCD: interviews, questionnaires, focus groups and participatory design. eSchi is an e-Therapy tool that complements traditional practices for the cognitive rehabilitation and training of schizophrenic patients and was successfully developed using a PCD approach.},

	abstract = {Background Lung cancer screening may provide a new opportunity for attempts to quit among smokers or might delay smoking cessation, but studies to date failed to provide evidence for this. This study investigated the effect of lung cancer screening on smoking abstinence in male smokers participating in the Dutch{\textendash}Belgian randomised controlled lung cancer screening trial (NELSON trial).Methods In the NELSON trial, 50- to 75-year-old participants at high risk for developing lung cancer were randomised to either lung cancer screening or no screening. Smoking behaviour was evaluated in two random samples of male smokers in the screen (n=641) and control arm (n=643) before (T0) and 2 years after randomisation (T1). In addition, the data were also analysed by intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, as recommended in smoking cessation intervention trials, although non-response in screening trials can also be due to reasons other than continued smoking.Results Almost 17\% (16.6\%) of the trial participants quit smoking, which is higher than the 3{\textendash}7\% found in the general adult population. However, screening was associated with a lower prolonged abstinence rate (14.5\%) compared with no screening (19.1\%) (OR 1.40, 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.92; p\&lt;0.05). No stastistically significant difference was found after performing an ITT analysis.Conclusions This study showed that all trial participants were inclined to stop smoking more than average, which suggests that screening is a teachable moment to improve smoking behaviour. In those who underwent screening the smoking abstinence rate was significantly lower than for the control group, although the difference was modest. After ITT analysis this difference was no longer observed.Clinical trial number ISRCTN63545820.},

	abstract = {Objective
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in North America. Low-dose computed tomography screening can reduce lung cancer--specific mortality by 20\%.
Method
The American Association for Thoracic Surgery created a multispecialty task force to create screening guidelines for groups at high risk of developing lung cancer and survivors of previous lung cancer.
Results
The American Association for Thoracic Surgery guidelines call for annual lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography screening for North Americans from age 55 to 79 years with a 30 pack-year history of smoking. Long-term lung cancer survivors should have annual low-dose computed tomography to detect second primary lung cancer until the age of 79 years. Annual low-dose computed tomography lung cancer screening should be offered starting at age 50 years with a 20 pack-year history if there is an additional cumulative risk of developing lung cancer of 5\% or greater over the following 5 years. Lung cancer screening requires participation by a subspecialty-qualified team. The American Association for Thoracic Surgery will continue engagement with other specialty societies to refine future screening guidelines.
Conclusions
The American Association for Thoracic Surgery provides specific guidelines for lung cancer screening in North America.},

	abstract = {The dangers of cigarette smoking are numerous and well-known, including the causal relationship to lung cancer. This study investigates the effect that smoking status at initial consultation has on radiation therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).We identified 237 patients treated between 1991 and 2001 with definitive radiation or chemoradiation who had complete smoking histories. Median age was 73, with 56\% males. Distribution by stage was as follows: I/II?27\%, IIIA?27\%, IIIB?45\%, recurrent?1\%. Two-year overall survival, stratified by stage of disease, was calculated from the time of initiation of treatment. Median follow-up time from the end of treatment was 13 months. Among those with stage I/II disease, current smokers had a 2-year survival rate of 41\% and a median survival of 13.7 months while non-smokers had a 2-year survival of 56\% and a median survival of 27.9 months (P=0.01). Patients with stage III disease did not show any significant differences in overall survival. There were no significant differences in cancer-specific survival in either stage. In conclusion, among NSCLC patients diagnosed with early stage disease, current smokers have a poorer prognosis for survival after radiation therapy.},

@article{roberts2013,
	abstract = {Introduction
The aim of this practice guideline was to develop evidence-based recommendations for screening high-risk populations for lung cancer.
Methods
The guideline was developed using the methods of Cancer Care Ontario's Program in Evidence-Based Care. The core methodology of the Program in Evidence-Based Care's guideline development process is systematic review. A systematic review had recently been completed by a collaboration of the American Cancer Society, the American College of Chest Physicians, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. The evidence from that systematic review formed the basis of the recommendations, which were reviewed, and amended where necessary, by clinical experts in the fields of medical and radiation oncology, radiology, lung disease, and population health.
Results
The systematic review included eight randomized controlled trials and 13 single-arm studies evaluating screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) in patients at risk for lung cancer. One large randomized trial reported a statistically significant reduction in lung cancer mortality with LDCT at 6 years compared with chest radiography. The practice guideline recommendations generally align with the parameters of the National Lung Screening Study. Deviations were described and justified by the guideline working group. The recommendations support screening persons at high-risk for lung cancer with advice for determining a positive result on LDCT, appropriate follow-up, and optimal screening interval.
Conclusion
The benefits of screening high-risk populations for lung cancer with LDCT outweigh the harms if screening is implemented in a strictly controlled manner.},

In the US it is estimated there are 17,000--26,000 annual deaths from lung cancer in never smokers, which as a separate entity would be the seventh leading cause of cancer mortality. Controversy surrounds the question of whether or not the incidence of lung cancer in never-smokers is increasing, with more data to support this observation in Asia. There are several factors associated with an increased risk of developing lung cancer in never smokers including second hand smoke, indoor air pollution, occupational exposures, and genetic susceptibility among others. Adenocarcinoma is the most common histology of lung cancer in never smokers and in comparison to lung cancer in smokers appears less complex with a higher likelihood to have targetable driver mutations.},
